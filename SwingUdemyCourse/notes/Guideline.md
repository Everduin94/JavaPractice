Master List of things to learn:

1) Binary Tree Implementation - Estimate: 2 - 5 hours
2) Java Swing Course - Estimate: 14+ hours
3) 100 Enki Cards - Estimate: about 5 lessons a day - 20 days
4) Effective Java - 1 Chapter every 2 weeks - 7 chapters left - 14 weeks
5) One coding challenge, or interview question a week minimum.

Start: December 2nd

Ideas for time management:
- Never doodle on the computer or phone
- Bring laptop to standups
- Use 30 minutes every morning for learning (Include Saturday and Sunday)
- No more Programming Deadlock.
    - I currently don't care about the next language to learn
    - I currently don't care what religious code topics people are arguing
    - I currently am aware of exactly what I need to accomplish
    - I will not deviate from that plan
    - If I'm stuck, I'll ask questions, If I can't ask, I'll study
    - Overall, spend significantly less time contemplating
        - and more time doing.
